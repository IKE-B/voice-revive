## Overview

Due to the removal of the larynx during this procedure, the **speech capabilities** of these patients are **severely impaired**.
While current solutions can restore their speech in a way, patients report problems like not being able to speak loudly, having a deep and rough voice, fast speaking fatigue, communication issues with strangers, ...

The goal of this project is to develop a **smartphone application** where:
1. users can speak with less (fatiguing) loudness
2. into a **microphone**, which sends the audio signal to
3. a smartphone that performs **audio transformations** on the incoming audio-stream in **real-time**, and
4. outputs the transformed audio to a **speaker** that drowns out the original voice.

The app provides multiple degrees of freedom for users to adjust their voice transformation to their liking.
This solution offers an improvement of the speech quality **on top of current treatments without further surgery or medical intervention**.
It only needs relatively cheap, commonly available hardware.

The two biggest challenges are implementing audio transformations that can achieve the desired voice quality and ensuring that they are applied in **real-time**,
to avoid jamming the speech of the users themselves.
Additionally, the app must be developed with special care for **usability and accessibility**, as the target group consists of elderly people in most parts.

The app is developed in [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), so it can be deployed on both **Android and iOS** devices.
Audio processing is done in [JUCE](https://juce.com/), a *C++* framework for audio applications, which makes a real-time audio processing possible.
